### Notes on running

The command `npm run dev` ought to be utilized during developement of the web application. It provides a developement environment with features like `code hot-reloading` (allows you to see immediate changes in the code whilst running the application without needing to manually stop and restart the application), `debugging tools` and `error messages` with detailed information.

Alternatively, `npm run prod` is used when for deployment purposes. Contrary the `dev` version this one optimizes the code for performance by minifying, bundling and reducing unnecssary code. It also removes debugging information and console logs, reducing the application's size and improving load times. In general, it typically results in a faster and more efficient web application.
