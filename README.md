## Project Description
An Online service through which you can schedule a meeting. Implemented using the **MERN** stack. <br/>
The Project is a part of the Programming Course "Programming Web Applications" (TWUN13 T3180) at JU. <br/> 

## Installation
1. Clone/Fork the project. <br />
2. Install **all** necessary packages using terminal command: `npm install` <br />
3. You can now run the web application using predefined scripts by invoking one of two terminal commands. <br /> 

**They are:**

    npm run dev 

or

    npm run prod
    
The first command, `npm run dev` ought to be utilized during developement of the web application. It provides a developement environment with features like `code hot-reloading` (allows you to see immediate changes in the code whilst running the application without needing to manually stop and restart the application), `debugging tools` and `error messages` with detailed information.

The second command, `npm run prod` is used when for deployment purposes. Contrary the `dev` version this one optimizes the code for performance by minifying, bundling and reducing unnecssary code. It also removes debugging information and console logs, reducing the application's size and improving load times. In general, it typically results in a faster and more efficient web application. 

4. Lastly you need to open the project in your browser. `localhost:3000`. You should now see the most update version of **Meetings**. It should look similair to the picture below.
